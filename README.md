# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can enjoy the game by playing against another player on the same device.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Two players can take turns playing the game on the same device.
- **Game Board**: A 3x3 grid where players can mark their moves.
- **Winning Detection**: The game automatically detects and announces the winner when a player gets three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- **Draw Detection**: The game also detects and announces a draw if all squares are filled without a winner.
- **Restart Option**: Players can restart the game to play again without refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the game board and interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the game board, layout, and player marks.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic, player interactions, and result detection.
